## PUMA

This is the top-level PUMA package.
Each individual sub-package (and sub-packages thereof, recursively) contains a README detailing its functionality and discussing the API and implementation details.
Please refer to these in conjunction with the source code.
The `multitask` package is possibly a good place to start reading.
